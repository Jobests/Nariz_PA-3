# PA 2 - Pandas
Python library for data manipulation and analysis
# Description of Problem
PROBLEM 1:
Using knowledge obtained from the experiment and demonstrations:

a. Load the corresponding .csv file into a data frame named cars using pandas

b. Display the first five and last five rows of the resulting cars.

PROBLEM 2:
Using the dataframe cars in problem 1, extract the following information using subsetting, slicing and
indexing operations.

a. Display the first five rows with odd-numbered columns (columns 1, 3, 5, 7...) of cars.

b. Display the row that contains the ‘Model’ of ‘Mazda RX4’.

c. How many cylinders (‘cyl’) does the car model ‘Camaro Z28’ have?

d. Determine how many cylinders (‘cyl’) and what gear type (‘gear’) do the car models ‘Mazda RX4 Wag’, ‘Ford Pantera L’ and ‘Honda Civic’ have.

# Problem 1
### Task Overview
In this task, a DataFrame containing car data from a CSV file, stored in the variable cars, was used to demonstrate basic data handling techniques in Pandas. The goal was to print the first and last 5 rows of the data and save the combined output to a CSV file.
